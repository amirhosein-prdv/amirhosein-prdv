I am a Telecommunications and Data Science Engineer with over 5 years of professional experience in data science and machine learning. I have worked on a wide range of projects spanning signal processing, wireless communication, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

I have developed complex machine learning models and algorithms, designed and implemented data pipelines, and optimized models for both accuracy and computational efficiency. I am experienced with major machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Gymnasium, Stable-baseline3, and PyTorch.

I am passionate about applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, with a strong focus on model accuracy, scalability, reliability, and the interpretation of complex datasets. My solid foundation in mathematical modeling and programming languages such as Python and MATLAB enables me to analyze complex data and derive actionable insights.



Below is a brief account of my background in electrical/telecommunication engineering education.



## Educational background
I have graduated with an M.Sc. in Telecommunication Systems from the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece). Nowadays, I am working as an R&D for AI and a signal processing engineer. I work and research on dynamic indoor localization with the help of machine learning algorithms.

I received a **B.Sc.** degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). 
I can program in Python and C++. My favorite fields are Artificial Intelligence, Wireless Communication, signal processing, and especially mobile communication in combination with artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning and deep learning. I have participated in natural language processing and vital signal processing projects with artificial intelligence, and I have experience in working with microcontrollers such as Arduino and STM32 and designing electronic boards in the Altium environment. I have done various projects both in university and in industry. In addition, working as a team and on practical projects is very attractive to me.

Furthermore, during my bachelor's degree, I have also concentrated on Machine Learning research in wireless communication and signal processing, specifically Deep Learning models. As a result, for my thesis, I am going to implement a Reinforcement-learning with the use of deep-learning models in wireless communication to develop `Cooperative communication with multi-UAVs` to improve parameters of communication links such as SNR, Bit rate, ... by choosing UAVs optimally under the supervision of [Dr. S. Mohammad Razavizadeh](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=jtR2cGMAAAAJ), Associate Professor at Iran University of Science and Technology.
