I'm a Communication Engineering student who is fond of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence special in Wireless Communication. My main passion lies on
Data Science (Machine learning, Deep learning, ...) and Wireless communication (6G, 5G, UAVs, ...). I'm Trying to improve skills in this domain as an everyday job.

Below is a short story on my background in electrical engineering education.
## Educational background
I'm studying **M.Sc.** in Telecommunication systems at [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece).Nowadays I working in [Sarveen Tech](https://sarveentech.ir) as a R&D for AI and Signal processing engineer. I working and research on dynamic indoor localization with help of machine learning algorithms.

I received a **B.Sc.** degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). 
I have the ability to program in Python and C++ languages. My favorite fields are Artificial intelligence, Wireless Communication, signal processing and especially mobile communication in combination with artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning and deep learning. I have participated in natural language processing and vital signal processing projects with artificial intelligence, and I have experience in working with microcontrollers such as Arduino and STM32 and designing electronic boards in the Altium environment, and I have done various projects both in university and in industry. In addition, working as a team and practical projects are very attractive for me.

Further more, During my bachelor's degree, I have also concentrated on Machine Learning research in wireless communication and signal processing, specifically Deep Learning models. As a result, for my thesis, I am going to implement a Reinforcement-learning with use of deep-learning models in wireless communication to develop `Cooperative communication with multi-UAVs` to improve parameters of communication's links such as SNR, Bit rate, ... by choosing UAVs optimally under the supervision of [Dr. S. Mohammad Razavizadeh](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=jtR2cGMAAAAJ), Associate Professor at Iran University of Science and Technology.

## My main research interests
- AI : Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning
- Signal processing
- Applications of machine learning in telecommunications
- wireless Communication (5G, 6G, UAVs, IRS, ...)
