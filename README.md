A University of Tehran graduate student who is enrolled in the telecommunication systems and data scientist programme. As a dedicated data scientist professional with +2 years of experience, I have worked on a wide range of projects, ranging from Signal processing to computer vision, recommendation systems, transformers and etc. I have developed complex machine learning models and algorithms, created data pipelines, and optimized machine learning models for both accuracy and speed. I have experience with various machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch. I am passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems and have a strong focus on model accuracy, scalability, and reliability and interpret complex data sets. I possess a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and programming languages such as Python and MATLAB, which have enabled me to analyze complex data sets and derive actionable insights.

Below is a short story on my background in electrical/telecommunication engineering education.

## Educational background
I'm studying **M.Sc.** in Telecommunication systems at [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece).Nowadays I working in [Sarveen Tech](https://sarveentech.ir) as a R&D for AI and Signal processing engineer. I work and research on dynamic indoor localization with help of machine learning algorithms.

I received a **B.Sc.** degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). 
I have the ability to program in Python and C++ languages. My favorite fields are Artificial intelligence, Wireless Communication, signal processing and especially mobile communication in combination with artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning and deep learning. I have participated in natural language processing and vital signal processing projects with artificial intelligence, and I have experience in working with microcontrollers such as Arduino and STM32 and designing electronic boards in the Altium environment, and I have done various projects both in university and in industry. In addition, working as a team and practical projects are very attractive for me.

Further more, During my bachelor's degree, I have also concentrated on Machine Learning research in wireless communication and signal processing, specifically Deep Learning models. As a result, for my thesis, I am going to implement a Reinforcement-learning with use of deep-learning models in wireless communication to develop `Cooperative communication with multi-UAVs` to improve parameters of communication's links such as SNR, Bit rate, ... by choosing UAVs optimally under the supervision of [Dr. S. Mohammad Razavizadeh](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=jtR2cGMAAAAJ), Associate Professor at Iran University of Science and Technology.
